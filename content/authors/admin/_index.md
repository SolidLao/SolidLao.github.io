I will be a PhD student in Computer Science at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) advised by Professor [Immanuel Trummer](https://itrummer.github.io/). I am currently interested in leveraging the advanced techniques from Natural Language Processing field (e.g., Large Language Model) to enhance the efficiency, usability and generality of database systems. During my time at [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/) as a B.Eng student, I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Mingjie Tang](https://merlintang.github.io/) and Professor [Jianguo Wang](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/csjgwang/) from [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), focusing on utilizing machine learning techniques to optimize database performance.
